# Hello World Static Page (Round 2)

## Overview
A minimal static web page that displays:
- A heading (h1) with “Hello, world!”
- A preformatted text block (pre)
- An image (img) sourced from the provided attachment `bye.jpg`

The page is fully static and suitable for deployment on GitHub Pages. Accessibility and performance considerations are included via descriptive alt text, `loading="lazy"`, and `decoding="async"`.

## Setup
1. Place the following files in your repository root:
   - `index.html`
   - `bye.jpg`
   - `README.md`

2. Commit and push to your GitHub repository.

3. Enable GitHub Pages:
   - Go to Settings → Pages
   - Select the branch (e.g., `main`) and the root folder
   - Save and wait for the site to be published

## Usage
- Open `index.html` locally in your browser, or visit the GitHub Pages URL once deployed.
- You should see:
  - The “Hello, world!” heading
  - A preformatted description block
  - The image rendered from `bye.jpg`

## Improvements in Round 2
- Replaced the previous `hello.jpg` with the new `bye.jpg` per the updated brief.
- Updated the HTML and README to reference `bye.jpg`.
- Added alt text to the image for accessibility, and `loading="lazy"` plus `decoding="async"` for performance.
- Light visual polish while keeping the page fully static and simple.
